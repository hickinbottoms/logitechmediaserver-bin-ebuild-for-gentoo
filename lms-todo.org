- [ ] runtime text relocations
 * QA Notice: The following files contain runtime text relocations
 *  Text relocations force the dynamic linker to perform extra
 *  work at startup, waste system resources, and may pose a security
 *  risk.  On some architectures, the code may not even function
 *  properly, if at all.
 *  For more information, see http://hardened.gentoo.org/pic-fix-guide.xml
 *  Please include the following list of files in your report:
 * TEXTREL opt/logitechmediaserver/CPAN/arch/5.10/arm-linux-gnueabi-thread-multi/auto/DBD/SQLite/SQLite.so
 * TEXTREL opt/logitechmediaserver/CPAN/arch/5.10/arm-linux-gnueabi-thread-multi/auto/Media/Scan/Scan.so

 *  Files with such sections will not work properly (or at all!) on some
 *  architectures/operating systems.  A bug should be filed at

 *  For more information, see http://hardened.gentoo.org/gnu-stack.xml
